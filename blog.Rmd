## Soul Glo Track Highlights

Soul Glo is a radio show that I DJ at the UAF student radio, KSUA 91.5 FM. I mainly play R&B music, from old school mowtown like The Impressions to more contemporary electro-soul like Busty and The Bass. You can hear it live most Tuesday's from 3:30 to 4:30 online at the station's [homepage](https://www.ksuaradio.com/) or check out the playlists below.

### Soul Glo Track Highlights 4/26/22

This week there was a greater focus on neo-soul and the newer electronic influences. I played several tracks from Busty and the Bass' sophomore album 'Uncommon Good'. Both 'Up Top' and 'Things Change' have that electric neo-soul feel, while still maintaining an old school vibe with the lead singer, Nick Ferraro raspy vocals. I particularly enjoy the opening to 'Up Top', it's a really creative and unique way to jump in to a song and serves as a great introduction to the vibe that Busty and the Bass give. 

I think my favorite track from this playlist is another song from Samm Henshaw, this time from his 2022 album Untidy Soul. Henshaw's 'Take Time' really does it all, the horn lines are dense with jazz vocabulary yet they still manage to fit so well around the vocals. The lyrics on the whole album(specifically this song) are filled with intimate notions of self-hood while still maintaining a lighthearted attitude. The song features Tobe Nwigwe rapping on the bridge and although the subject matter might jarring for some, the verse serves as a beautiful, prophetic message to those who confuse lust with love.

The playlist I put together this week highlighted the kind of vibe we hear on D'Angelo's 'Spanish Joint' and 'Untitled (How Does It Feel)'. This free, bass driven r&b vibe is very ubiquitous in 2000's classic soul genre. In general there is no going wrong with playing a little D'Angelo! For first time listeners I would recommend 'I Found My Smile Again', I find that it strikes the perfect balance between the bluesiness found in reprise of 'How Does It Feel' and the exaggerated layers of vocal harmony found in 'Spanish Joint' all while not overwhelming the listener with a 4+ minute run time.

Samm Henshaw's 'How Does It Feel?' is another track from this playlist that I think really captures the new sound we are hearing in the neo-soul, and indie pop scenes. Lots of gospel influences in this track from the stacked vocal harmonies on the hook, to Henshaw's adlibs between each section.
